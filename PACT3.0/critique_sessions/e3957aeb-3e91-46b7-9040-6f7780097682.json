  "final_critique": "The pre-work articulates a timely and socially consequential problem: how individuals across the U.S. partisan divide can connect and reduce interpersonal and affective polarization. The author motivates the topic with compelling personal and professional experiences and demonstrates nascent awareness of relevant literatures (affective polarization, contact theory, deliberation, and social media echo chambers). The memo also candidly surfaces potential biases, which is commendable for reflexivity. However, at this stage the document remains an interest statement rather than a research blueprint. It lacks a clearly specified research question, theoretical framing, operational definitions, proposed design, measurement plan, sampling strategy, and analytic approach. The framing leans asymmetrically toward one partisan direction, risking confirmatory bias and reduced external validity. Reliance on anecdote, AI-generated scoping, and goals tied to partisan electoral outcomes may further complicate research neutrality and ethics. To advance, the project needs to (1) formulate precise, testable questions (e.g., which interventions reduce cross-partisan relational strain in dyads? which mechanisms\u2014empathy, perspective-taking, identity affirmation\u2014mediate effects?); (2) define key constructs and outcomes (e.g., affective polarization, willingness to interact, perceived relationship quality, trust, misperception accuracy); (3) adopt a balanced, symmetrical design that treats both partisan groups consistently; and (4) specify a rigorous methodology (e.g., mixed-methods: preregistered field experiments with measured behavioral outcomes, complemented by qualitative dyadic interviews). Attention to sampling (cross-partisan dyads, geographic diversity), measurement validity (established scales, behavioral indicators, longitudinal follow-up), ethics (informed consent, potential harm in re-engaging strained relationships), and transparency (preregistration, open materials) will be essential. With these steps, the project can move from an important motivation to a credible, generalizable contribution on rebuilding cross-ideological relationships.",
