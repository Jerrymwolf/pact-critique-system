A recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll indicates that 26% of Democrats and 24% of Republicans say they have had a friendship or family relationship end because of a disagreement over politics. This topic can yield answers on how we calm political hostilities in America, and best reach people who hold diametrically opposing viewpoints.\n2) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nPolitical strife has caused division within friendships, communities, houses of worship, and even families. I want to explore the effective strategies for how to connect with individuals who harbor vastly different political beliefs, while also exploring what these individuals need in order to be open to such a discussion. I believe the applications of these research findings can include helping Democrats win elections, while also aiding people across the nation in re-connecting with loved ones and restoring more civility to our political discourse.\n3) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nI\u2019m intrigued by this topic because I believe political division is an existential threat to our nation\u2019s democracy. I host a political talk show every day where I hold space for Republicans and Democrats to both share their beliefs, and so many people have expressed their heartfelt appreciation for this format as it\u2019s so rare to find. What has stuck out to me the most in the past months is when I had a young caller who asked me for the best strategies to re-build a bridge with his father, a MAGA Republican, whom he had a strained relationship with over political differences. I gave him the best advice I could, including listening with empathy, showing respect and deference, and keeping a calm and patient tone. He called in the next day and told me, with tears in his eyes, that this worked - and he and his father were having lunch the next week. This moved me deeply. and I want to go deeper here, working to find new strategies to make stories like this one more common across the nation.\n4) What work, if any, have you already done on this topic? \nI am interested in this topic and I\u2019m starting my research from scratch. I held a brainstorming session with Jerry and was sharing my concerns about the future of American democracy, and I\u2019m hoping this topic can help heal our nation. If we as Americans don\u2019t even talk to those with whom we disagree, we will never be able to reconcile our political differences to move progress forward. \n5) What do you hope to gain personally and professionally by studying this topic?\nI have served in elected office since I\u2019m 18 years old, and I\u2019m committed to continuing to influence public life - this time outside of elected office. I want to make a positive difference for our country, and I believe this is a strong way I can pursue this goal. Moreover, I want to learn the best strategies to bridge this gap so I can take these research findings across the nation and help mend fences in our communities. Lastly, I believe that many people will be interested in my research findings, and I hope that these answers will glean interest from America\u2019s top political programs.\n6) What biases and assumptions do you bring with you that relate to this topic?\nFirst, my clear and evident bias stems from my political affiliation: I am a proud Democrat, and not a Republican. I\u2019ve never voted for Donald Trump, and believe many  ultra-conservatives who support Trump are currently threatening our democracy. And secondly, I am personally biased in my own understanding of what works and what doesn\u2019t from my experience on my talk show in this arena. In terms of my assumptions, I first assume from my experience serving in elected office that the most pressing research issue will be figuring out how Democrats can best reach MAGA Republicans, as opposed to vice versa. And secondly, I assume that more MAGA Republicans would openly identify as having hostility to Democrats, and express a potential unwillingness to communicate with those on the opposite political spectrum.\nPre-Work - Brief Topic Description\nAI shared that there is an existing wealth of information where the literature is strongest on this topic. I was first advised to explore the topic of Affective Polarization, which looks at the topics of partisan distrust and how there is an increasing level of hostility between partisans that expands beyond just basic policy disagreements. In terms of what\u2019s referred to as Contact Theory, AI suggested I look into research which has found intergroup contact - or the direct contact between Republicans and Democrats - has actually reduced prejudice, and observed voters actually adapt their political psychology. Next, AI discussed the existence of research on Political Deliberation, where scholars have studied cross-ideological discourse, and best practices of speaking to those across the aisle. And in terms of contemporary topics, AI spoke about the need to research Echo Chambers & Social Media, looking at existing literature about how these new online platforms have exacerbated the political separation of those who disagree.\nAI also identified multiple gaps within the existing research, which makes this topic both important and research-worthy. First, AI identified a gap regarding \u201cEmpirical Models for Reconnection\u201d, suggesting that there are fewer available studies which center around the concept of reconciliation in our personal lives, specifically in everyday settings like in our families and at work. Secondly, there is an existing research gap in terms of the differences of partisan outreach strategy, where more research is needed on how these different groups approach topics like building trust among one another, and finding ideological common ground. Lastly, AI suggested I look at the role of identity and emotion, sharing that while major focus has already been paid to cognition or attitude change, there is less research on the concepts of \u201cemotional repair, shame, pride, and belonging\u201d.",

  "final_critique": "This pre-work document articulates a compelling and socially consequential topic: how individuals at opposite ends of the political spectrum can connect across differences in everyday contexts. The author demonstrates strong personal motivation and early awareness of relevant literatures (affective polarization, intergroup contact, deliberation, and echo chambers). The candid disclosure of political identity and potential biases is commendable and lays groundwork for reflexive research practice.\n\nAt this stage, however, the work reads as an exploratory concept note rather than a research design. The central constructs (e.g., \u201cconnect,\u201d \u201crebuild a bridge,\u201d \u201chostility,\u201d \u201copenness\u201d) are not yet defined or operationalized, and the aims oscillate between relational healing and partisan electoral objectives. This ambiguity risks undermining internal coherence and external credibility. To strengthen research foundations, the topic should be reframed in nonpartisan terms, with clear constructs and testable propositions anchored in established theory.\n\nMethodologically, the paper does not yet specify research questions, hypotheses, sampling frames, settings, measures, or analytic strategies. The anecdote from the talk show is powerful as motivation but cannot substitute for systematic evidence. Concrete next steps include: (1) defining scope (e.g., close relationships such as parent\u2013adult child dyads versus acquaintances; offline versus online interactions); (2) translating aims into specific research questions (e.g., Which conversational strategies measurably increase willingness to maintain cross-partisan relationships? Under what conditions? For whom?); and (3) specifying a design. A feasible path is a mixed-methods program: an experimental or quasi-experimental study of structured cross-partisan conversations paired with qualitative interviews to surface mechanisms.\n\nIllustrative design: Recruit balanced cross-partisan dyads from family or close-friend networks; randomly assign dyads to interventions such as perspective-getting (asking the other to describe their view and reasons), values-affirmation, or moral reframing, versus control (unstructured conversation). Use pre/post measures of outcomes like affective thermometer scores, relational closeness, willingness to continue discussion, perceived respect, and behavioral intentions (e.g., scheduling a follow-up conversation). Validate constructs with established scales (e.g., feeling thermometers or social distance indices for outgroup warmth; perceived understanding/respect scales; empathic concern; psychological safety; willingness-to-engage indices). Incorporate manipulation checks, social desirability controls, and blinded coders for conversation transcripts. Complement with semi-structured interviews to probe mechanisms (identity threat reduction, dignity, recognition).\n\nTo address bias and ethics, pre-register hypotheses, employ preregistered analysis plans, and ensure ideological symmetry in sampling, recruitment materials, and measurement invariance testing across groups. Guard against harm with IRB review, clear consent, opt-out protocols, and safeguards for participants in strained relationships. Analytically, plan for multilevel models (dyads nested within recruitment sources), moderation by identity centrality and media diet, and mediation tests (e.g., does perceived respect mediate changes in willingness to engage?).\n\nStructurally, the document is readable but repetitive, and the duplicated prompts (Questions 2 and 3) highlight the need to streamline the narrative. A clearer throughline would link literature to gaps and then to a specific, feasible research plan. A theory-of-change diagram would help: intervention components (e.g., perspective-getting, dignity cues) reduce identity threat and increase perceived respect, which increases willingness to engage, which predicts relational maintenance.\n\nActionable recommendations:\n- Clarify scope and neutrality: Reframe aims around bidirectional bridge-building, not partisan advantage; define the population (e.g., adult family dyads) and context (offline conversations).\n- Specify research questions and hypotheses: For example, H1: Structured perspective-getting increases willingness to schedule a follow-up cross-partisan conversation relative to unstructured discussion; H2: Effects are mediated by perceived respect; H3: Effects are moderated by identity fusion and perceived moralization of politics.\n- Operationalize outcomes and mechanisms: Pre-register primary outcomes (behavioral follow-up, change in warmth, relational closeness), secondary outcomes (empathic concern, misperception correction), and process measures (perceived understanding, dignity).\n- Design and sampling: Balanced recruitment of Democrats and Republicans; screen for baseline relational strain; ensure safety criteria; consider stratification by relationship type.\n- Analysis and transparency: Pre-register, power analysis, open materials and code, and plan robustness checks (e.g., excluding highly asymmetric dyads, adjusting for social desirability).\n\nOverall, this is a promising, socially relevant project with clear motivation and early literature awareness. Converting it into rigorous scholarship will require sharpening constructs, neutral framing, and a concrete, ethical, and adequately powered research design.",
