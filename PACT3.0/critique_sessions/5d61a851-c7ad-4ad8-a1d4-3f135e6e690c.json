It also shows preliminary awareness of relevant literatures (affective polarization, intergroup contact, deliberation, and the role of social media) and tentatively identifies promising gaps (reconnection in everyday life, partisan asymmetries in outreach, and the emotional/identity dimensions of repair). However, as a scholarly foundation for a master\u2019s thesis, the document remains at an exploratory stage. The central problem is framed normatively and sometimes instrumentally (e.g., advancing partisan electoral goals), which risks compromising neutrality and the design of credible inquiry. Key constructs (e.g., \u201cconnection,\u201d \u201copenness,\u201d \u201chostility,\u201d \u201creconciliation\u201d) are not defined or operationalized; there are no research questions, hypotheses, or a theoretical model linking mechanisms (e.g., identity threat, motivated reasoning, empathy, contact conditions) to measurable outcomes. The reliance on an anecdote is compelling for motivation but insufficient as evidence or design guidance. Methodologically, no choices are specified regarding unit of analysis (individuals, dyads, families, communities), setting (family, workplace, online), sampling frame, study design (experiment, field intervention, longitudinal panel, qualitative comparative work), measures (e.g., validated scales for affective polarization, social distance, empathy, trust, willingness to engage), analysis strategy, or bias mitigation. Ethical considerations, which are nontrivial due to potential psychological harm in high-conflict interactions, are absent. Structurally, the narrative is readable but contains redundancy (duplicate question), minor editorial issues, and placeholder attributions to \u201cAI\u201d rather than synthesized, cited scholarship. To advance toward a robust thesis: (1) sharpen the research aim into specific, testable questions (e.g., which dialogue practices increase cross-partisan willingness to sustain contact within family dyads over 3 months? Are effects symmetric across party ID?); (2) anchor the work in a clear theoretical frame that integrates affective polarization, intergroup contact conditions, identity-protective cognition, and emotional regulation; (3) choose a feasible design (e.g., a pre-registered field experiment or lab-in-the-field study comparing dialogue protocols; or a mixed-methods longitudinal diary plus survey approach); (4) specify validated outcome and mediator measures and a plan for reliability/validity and causal identification; (5) include concrete strategies for bias control (reflexivity memoing, blinding in coding, preregistration) and ethical safeguards (risk screening, de-escalation protocols, IRB). Reframing any instrumental partisan aims as separate translational implications, rather than primary research objectives, will strengthen perceived neutrality and credibility.",
