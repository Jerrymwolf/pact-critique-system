A recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll indicates that 26% of Democrats and 24% of Republicans say they have had a friendship or family relationship end because of a disagreement over politics. This topic can yield answers on how we calm political hostilities in America, and best reach people who hold diametrically opposing viewpoints.\n2) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nPolitical strife has caused division within friendships, communities, houses of worship, and even families. I want to explore the effective strategies for how to connect with individuals who harbor vastly different political beliefs, while also exploring what these individuals need in order to be open to such a discussion. I believe the applications of these research findings can include helping Democrats win elections, while also aiding people across the nation in re-connecting with loved ones and restoring more civility to our political discourse.\n3) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nI\u2019m intrigued by this topic because I believe political division is an existential threat to our nation\u2019s democracy. I host a political talk show every day where I hold space for Republicans and Democrats to both share their beliefs, and so many people have expressed their heartfelt appreciation for this format as it\u2019s so rare to find. What has stuck out to me the most in the past months is when I had a young caller who asked me for the best strategies to re-build a bridge with his father, a MAGA Republican, whom he had a strained relationship with over political differences. I gave him the best advice I could, including listening with empathy, showing respect and deference, and keeping a calm and patient tone. He called in the next day and told me, with tears in his eyes, that this worked - and he and his father were having lunch the next week. This moved me deeply. and I want to go deeper here, working to find new strategies to make stories like this one more common across the nation.\n4) What work, if any, have you already done on this topic? \nI am interested in this topic and I\u2019m starting my research from scratch. I held a brainstorming session with Jerry and was sharing my concerns about the future of American democracy, and I\u2019m hoping this topic can help heal our nation. If we as Americans don\u2019t even talk to those with whom we disagree, we will never be able to reconcile our political differences to move progress forward. \n5) What do you hope to gain personally and professionally by studying this topic?\nI have served in elected office since I\u2019m 18 years old, and I\u2019m committed to continuing to influence public life - this time outside of elected office. I want to make a positive difference for our country, and I believe this is a strong way I can pursue this goal. Moreover, I want to learn the best strategies to bridge this gap so I can take these research findings across the nation and help mend fences in our communities. Lastly, I believe that many people will be interested in my research findings, and I hope that these answers will glean interest from America\u2019s top political programs.\n6) What biases and assumptions do you bring with you that relate to this topic?\nFirst, my clear and evident bias stems from my political affiliation: I am a proud Democrat, and not a Republican. I\u2019ve never voted for Donald Trump, and believe many  ultra-conservatives who support Trump are currently threatening our democracy. And secondly, I am personally biased in my own understanding of what works and what doesn\u2019t from my experience on my talk show in this arena. In terms of my assumptions, I first assume from my experience serving in elected office that the most pressing research issue will be figuring out how Democrats can best reach MAGA Republicans, as opposed to vice versa. And secondly, I assume that more MAGA Republicans would openly identify as having hostility to Democrats, and express a potential unwillingness to communicate with those on the opposite political spectrum.\nPre-Work - Brief Topic Description\nAI shared that there is an existing wealth of information where the literature is strongest on this topic. I was first advised to explore the topic of Affective Polarization, which looks at the topics of partisan distrust and how there is an increasing level of hostility between partisans that expands beyond just basic policy disagreements. In terms of what\u2019s referred to as Contact Theory, AI suggested I look into research which has found intergroup contact - or the direct contact between Republicans and Democrats - has actually reduced prejudice, and observed voters actually adapt their political psychology. Next, AI discussed the existence of research on Political Deliberation, where scholars have studied cross-ideological discourse, and best practices of speaking to those across the aisle. And in terms of contemporary topics, AI spoke about the need to research Echo Chambers & Social Media, looking at existing literature about how these new online platforms have exacerbated the political separation of those who disagree.\nAI also identified multiple gaps within the existing research, which makes this topic both important and research-worthy. First, AI identified a gap regarding \u201cEmpirical Models for Reconnection\u201d, suggesting that there are fewer available studies which center around the concept of reconciliation in our personal lives, specifically in everyday settings like in our families and at work. Secondly, there is an existing research gap in terms of the differences of partisan outreach strategy, where more research is needed on how these different groups approach topics like building trust among one another, and finding ideological common ground. Lastly, AI suggested I look at the role of identity and emotion, sharing that while major focus has already been paid to cognition or attitude change, there is less research on the concepts of \u201cemotional repair, shame, pride, and belonging\u201d.",

  "final_critique": "The pre-work outlines a timely and socially consequential thesis area: how individuals across the partisan spectrum can connect despite deep ideological divides. It demonstrates strong motivation, nascent awareness of relevant literatures (affective polarization, contact theory, deliberative democracy, echo chambers), and candid reflexivity about positionality. However, as a research blueprint it remains under-specified. Key constructs (e.g., \u201cconnect,\u201d \u201chostility,\u201d \u201creconciliation\u201d) are not yet operationalized; the central research question is broad and normatively framed (including an explicit electoral aim), which risks biasing design, measurement, and interpretation. The current document relies on anecdote rather than established measures or empirical strategy, and the scope oscillates between interpersonal repair (family, workplace) and macro-level persuasion. To progress toward a rigorous thesis, you should: (1) sharpen the research question to a testable form, e.g., Which conversational strategies increase willingness to engage, perceived respect, and reduction in outgroup animus among strong partisans in dyadic interactions? (2) define outcomes using validated instruments (e.g., feeling thermometers, affective polarization indices, perceived respect scales, willingness-to-engage measures, misperception items) and consider behavioral outcomes (future contact, conversation duration, willingness to exchange contact info); (3) articulate a theory of change linking identity threat, perceived respect, and contact quality to downstream outcomes, drawing from motivated reasoning, identity-protective cognition, intergroup emotion theory, and moral reframing; (4) adopt a feasible mixed-methods design\u2014e.g., Phase 1 qualitative interviews with cross-partisan dyads to surface mechanisms and language; Phase 2 pre-registered field or online RCT comparing conversational frames (perspective-getting vs perspective-taking, moral reframing, empathic listening training) with symmetric treatment across parties; (5) plan sampling (stratified by partisan strength and media diet), power analysis, and preregistration to counter bias; (6) implement ethical safeguards (risk screening, de-escalation protocols, opt-out, post-session debriefing), especially for family dyads. Finally, to maintain scholarly neutrality, separate normative or partisan aims from your empirical objectives; present applied implications for multiple stakeholders (civic groups, educators, practitioners) without privileging one party. With focused questions, clear constructs, and a transparent design, this project could yield practical and academically credible insights into depolarization and relationship repair.",
