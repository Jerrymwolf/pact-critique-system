While the text is clear and unambiguous about its provisional nature, it offers no foundation on which to assess contribution, rigor, or significance. To transform this into a viable paper, the authors should: (1) articulate a precise research question and motivation, situating the work within relevant literature and identifying a gap; (2) specify hypotheses or objectives; (3) design a methodology with data sources, procedures, metrics, and analysis plans, including baselines and ablations where appropriate; (4) plan an evaluation strategy (quantitative and/or qualitative), with attention to validity, reliability, and limitations; and (5) organize the manuscript into conventional sections (abstract, introduction, related work, methods, experiments, results, discussion, limitations/ethics, conclusion) with appropriate citations. Without these elements, the work cannot be assessed for originality, impact, or reproducibility.",
