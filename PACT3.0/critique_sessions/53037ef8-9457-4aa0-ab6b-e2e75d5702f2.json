The motivation is compelling and grounded in lived experience, and the author usefully flags several relevant literatures (affective polarization, intergroup contact, deliberation, and echo chambers). The identification of potential research gaps\u2014empirical models of personal reconciliation, asymmetries in partisan outreach strategies, and the role of identity and emotion\u2014is promising and provides a plausible entry point for an academic thesis.\n\nAt this stage, however, the work remains at the level of topic motivation rather than a research plan. Key constructs (e.g., \u201cconnect,\u201d \u201cbe open,\u201d \u201creconciliation\u201d) are not yet defined or operationalized; the target setting (families, workplaces, or civic forums) is not specified; and the population of interest is unclear (e.g., strong partisans, leaners, independents). The dual aims of improving civic relationships and helping one party win elections introduce a normative and strategic bias that, if not explicitly bracketed, will compromise neutrality and research credibility. The draft also leans heavily on a single poll statistic and AI-curated pointers without citations, which weakens the scholarly foundation.\n\nTo strengthen the project, first sharpen the research question and scope. For example, focus on reconciliation in close relationships (family/friends) rather than electoral persuasion, and specify whether the goal is to increase willingness to engage, reduce outgroup animus, or repair trust. Translate these into measurable outcomes (e.g., feeling thermometers, trust scales, willingness-to-meet indices, dehumanization measures, behavioral intentions such as scheduling a call). Second, articulate a conceptual framework linking antecedents (perceived threat, moralization, identity centrality), mechanisms (perceived respect, perspective-taking, trust), and outcomes (openness, sustained contact), along with boundary conditions (relationship closeness, media diet, local context).\n\nMethodologically, consider a mixed-method design: (a) qualitative interviews with individuals who have experienced estrangement/reconnection to surface strategies and barriers; (b) preregistered survey experiments testing message strategies (empathy affirmations, respectful tone, superordinate goals) and messenger characteristics (co-partisan vs cross-partisan vs apolitical) on outcomes of openness and trust; and (c) a small field pilot of structured dialogues, with pre/post and follow-up measures to assess durability. Use stratified sampling for political identification and intensity, include Independents, and plan for heterogeneity analyses by ideology strength and media consumption. Implement bias safeguards (explicitly bracket partisan goals, use balanced stimuli, blind coders, intercoder reliability), and attend to ethics and risk (IRB, privacy, do-no-harm protocols for family relationships). Finally, improve structure by removing duplicated sections, adding concise literature scaffolding with citations, and presenting a clear timeline and deliverables.\n\nOverall, this is a promising and meaningful thesis direction, but it requires a tighter research question, stronger theoretical anchoring, and a concrete, neutral, and ethically sound methodology to achieve academic rigor.",
