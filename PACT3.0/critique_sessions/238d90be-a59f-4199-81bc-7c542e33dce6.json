A recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll indicates that 26% of Democrats and 24% of Republicans say they have had a friendship or family relationship end because of a disagreement over politics. This topic can yield answers on how we calm political hostilities in America, and best reach people who hold diametrically opposing viewpoints.\n2) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nPolitical strife has caused division within friendships, communities, houses of worship, and even families. I want to explore the effective strategies for how to connect with individuals who harbor vastly different political beliefs, while also exploring what these individuals need in order to be open to such a discussion. I believe the applications of these research findings can include helping Democrats win elections, while also aiding people across the nation in re-connecting with loved ones and restoring more civility to our political discourse.\n3) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nI\u2019m intrigued by this topic because I believe political division is an existential threat to our nation\u2019s democracy. I host a political talk show every day where I hold space for Republicans and Democrats to both share their beliefs, and so many people have expressed their heartfelt appreciation for this format as it\u2019s so rare to find. What has stuck out to me the most in the past months is when I had a young caller who asked me for the best strategies to re-build a bridge with his father, a MAGA Republican, whom he had a strained relationship with over political differences. I gave him the best advice I could, including listening with empathy, showing respect and deference, and keeping a calm and patient tone. He called in the next day and told me, with tears in his eyes, that this worked - and he and his father were having lunch the next week. This moved me deeply. and I want to go deeper here, working to find new strategies to make stories like this one more common across the nation.\n4) What work, if any, have you already done on this topic? \nI am interested in this topic and I\u2019m starting my research from scratch. I held a brainstorming session with Jerry and was sharing my concerns about the future of American democracy, and I\u2019m hoping this topic can help heal our nation. If we as Americans don\u2019t even talk to those with whom we disagree, we will never be able to reconcile our political differences to move progress forward. \n5) What do you hope to gain personally and professionally by studying this topic?\nI have served in elected office since I\u2019m 18 years old, and I\u2019m committed to continuing to influence public life - this time outside of elected office. I want to make a positive difference for our country, and I believe this is a strong way I can pursue this goal. Moreover, I want to learn the best strategies to bridge this gap so I can take these research findings across the nation and help mend fences in our communities. Lastly, I believe that many people will be interested in my research findings, and I hope that these answers will glean interest from America\u2019s top political programs.\n6) What biases and assumptions do you bring with you that relate to this topic?\nFirst, my clear and evident bias stems from my political affiliation: I am a proud Democrat, and not a Republican. I\u2019ve never voted for Donald Trump, and believe many  ultra-conservatives who support Trump are currently threatening our democracy. And secondly, I am personally biased in my own understanding of what works and what doesn\u2019t from my experience on my talk show in this arena. In terms of my assumptions, I first assume from my experience serving in elected office that the most pressing research issue will be figuring out how Democrats can best reach MAGA Republicans, as opposed to vice versa. And secondly, I assume that more MAGA Republicans would openly identify as having hostility to Democrats, and express a potential unwillingness to communicate with those on the opposite political spectrum.\nPre-Work - Brief Topic Description\nAI shared that there is an existing wealth of information where the literature is strongest on this topic. I was first advised to explore the topic of Affective Polarization, which looks at the topics of partisan distrust and how there is an increasing level of hostility between partisans that expands beyond just basic policy disagreements. In terms of what\u2019s referred to as Contact Theory, AI suggested I look into research which has found intergroup contact - or the direct contact between Republicans and Democrats - has actually reduced prejudice, and observed voters actually adapt their political psychology. Next, AI discussed the existence of research on Political Deliberation, where scholars have studied cross-ideological discourse, and best practices of speaking to those across the aisle. And in terms of contemporary topics, AI spoke about the need to research Echo Chambers & Social Media, looking at existing literature about how these new online platforms have exacerbated the political separation of those who disagree.\nAI also identified multiple gaps within the existing research, which makes this topic both important and research-worthy. First, AI identified a gap regarding \u201cEmpirical Models for Reconnection\u201d, suggesting that there are fewer available studies which center around the concept of reconciliation in our personal lives, specifically in everyday settings like in our families and at work. Secondly, there is an existing research gap in terms of the differences of partisan outreach strategy, where more research is needed on how these different groups approach topics like building trust among one another, and finding ideological common ground. Lastly, AI suggested I look at the role of identity and emotion, sharing that while major focus has already been paid to cognition or attitude change, there is less research on the concepts of \u201cemotional repair, shame, pride, and belonging\u201d.",

  "final_critique": "This pre-work articulates a timely, societally consequential topic: how people with opposing political identities can connect across profound disagreements. The motivation is sincere and grounded in lived experience, and the brief correctly gestures to core literatures (affective polarization, contact theory, deliberation, echo chambers). However, as a research prospectus, it remains largely aspirational. The document blends advocacy goals (e.g., helping Democrats win elections) with scholarly aims (understanding reconciliation and cross-partisan connection), which risks compromising neutrality, framing, and the credibility of any eventual findings. The piece also lacks a clear, operationalized research question, does not define constructs, and provides no methodological roadmap. As written, it is better characterized as a rationale for inquiry than as a research plan. Research foundations: The overview names several relevant scholarly domains and plausibly identifies gaps related to personal reconciliation, partisan asymmetries in outreach strategy, and the role of emotion and identity. Yet the review is cursory and second-order\u2014mediated through AI suggestions rather than anchored in direct engagement with the primary literature. There are no key constructs defined (e.g., affective polarization vs. ideological polarization; reconciliation vs. attitude change; trust vs. warmth), no explicit theoretical model linking mechanisms (e.g., identity threats, motivated reasoning, moral reframing) to expected outcomes, and no references to canonical measures or landmark studies. A strong foundation would synthesize theories (e.g., social identity and identity-protective cognition, motivated reasoning, moral foundations, deliberative democracy), specify hypothesized mechanisms (e.g., perceived respect \u2192 reduced threat \u2192 increased conversational openness), and tie them to measurable outcomes. Methodological rigor: The brief does not articulate a study design, sampling frame, instruments, hypotheses, or analytic plan. Without these, risks include confirmation bias, social desirability, and non-representative convenience samples (e.g., talk-show callers). It will be crucial to define outcomes such as conversational openness, perspective-taking, trust, warmth (e.g., feeling thermometers), dehumanization, and willingness for future contact; to pre-register hypotheses; and to detail protocols. Mixed methods are promising: (a) qualitative interviews to surface barriers, norms, and emotional dynamics in family/work settings; (b) field or lab experiments testing contact/deliberation interventions (e.g., deep canvassing, moral reframing, structured dialogue prompts) with pre/post measures and follow-up; and (c) observational studies of naturally occurring cross-ideological conversations. Attention to ethics, risk of harm in high-conflict relationships, and balanced recruitment across partisan identities is essential. Structure and coherence: The narrative is clear in motivation but repetitive (duplicate prompts on what intrigues you), occasionally imprecise, and intermittently conflates personal anecdotes with evidence. The document would benefit from a sharper framing that separates personal purpose, academic inquiry, and potential applications. A coherent arc would move from (1) problem framing and significance, to (2) theoretical synthesis and gaps, to (3) specific research questions and hypotheses, to (4) proposed methods and expected contributions. Actionable recommendations: 1) Clarify scope and neutrality: Separate scholarly aims (understanding mechanisms of cross-partisan connection) from partisan objectives. Consider a balanced, bidirectional framing (how can Democrats and Republicans connect?), and institute safeguards (e.g., advisory board with diverse ideological representation, reflexivity statement, and pre-registration). 2) Define constructs and outcomes: Operationalize key variables (e.g., affective polarization, conversational openness, trust, emotional repair) and identify validated measures. 3) Specify research questions and hypotheses: Example RQ1: Which conversational strategies (e.g., perspective-taking prompts, values-based moral reframing, deep canvassing) increase willingness for future cross-ideological contact over 4\u20138 weeks? H1: Empathy-plus-respect protocols will produce larger gains in trust and warmth than policy-focused debate. 4) Propose a mixed-methods design: Phase 1 qualitative interviews (N\u224830\u201350) to map barriers and strategies; Phase 2 pilot RCT testing conversational interventions (pre/post and follow-up measures); Phase 3 extension in family/work settings with safety protocols. 5) Address sampling and ethics: Recruit balanced samples across partisan identity; include safeguards for high-conflict dyads; use blinded coding and independent raters; pre-register analyses; and report nulls. 6) Link to theory: Integrate social identity threats, motivated reasoning, identity-protective cognition, and moral reframing into a testable causal model connecting perceived respect to reduced threat and increased openness. With these improvements, the project can make a meaningful scholarly and practical contribution at the intersection of political psychology, intergroup relations, and deliberative practice.",
