A recent Yahoo News/YouGov poll indicates that 26% of Democrats and 24% of Republicans say they have had a friendship or family relationship end because of a disagreement over politics. This topic can yield answers on how we calm political hostilities in America, and best reach people who hold diametrically opposing viewpoints.\n2) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nPolitical strife has caused division within friendships, communities, houses of worship, and even families. I want to explore the effective strategies for how to connect with individuals who harbor vastly different political beliefs, while also exploring what these individuals need in order to be open to such a discussion. I believe the applications of these research findings can include helping Democrats win elections, while also aiding people across the nation in re-connecting with loved ones and restoring more civility to our political discourse.\n3) What intrigues you about this topic? And why?\nI\u2019m intrigued by this topic because I believe political division is an existential threat to our nation\u2019s democracy. I host a political talk show every day where I hold space for Republicans and Democrats to both share their beliefs, and so many people have expressed their heartfelt appreciation for this format as it\u2019s so rare to find. What has stuck out to me the most in the past months is when I had a young caller who asked me for the best strategies to re-build a bridge with his father, a MAGA Republican, whom he had a strained relationship with over political differences. I gave him the best advice I could, including listening with empathy, showing respect and deference, and keeping a calm and patient tone. He called in the next day and told me, with tears in his eyes, that this worked - and he and his father were having lunch the next week. This moved me deeply. and I want to go deeper here, working to find new strategies to make stories like this one more common across the nation.\n4) What work, if any, have you already done on this topic? \nI am interested in this topic and I\u2019m starting my research from scratch. I held a brainstorming session with Jerry and was sharing my concerns about the future of American democracy, and I\u2019m hoping this topic can help heal our nation. If we as Americans don\u2019t even talk to those with whom we disagree, we will never be able to reconcile our political differences to move progress forward. \n5) What do you hope to gain personally and professionally by studying this topic?\nI have served in elected office since I\u2019m 18 years old, and I\u2019m committed to continuing to influence public life - this time outside of elected office. I want to make a positive difference for our country, and I believe this is a strong way I can pursue this goal. Moreover, I want to learn the best strategies to bridge this gap so I can take these research findings across the nation and help mend fences in our communities. Lastly, I believe that many people will be interested in my research findings, and I hope that these answers will glean interest from America\u2019s top political programs.\n6) What biases and assumptions do you bring with you that relate to this topic?\nFirst, my clear and evident bias stems from my political affiliation: I am a proud Democrat, and not a Republican. I\u2019ve never voted for Donald Trump, and believe many  ultra-conservatives who support Trump are currently threatening our democracy. And secondly, I am personally biased in my own understanding of what works and what doesn\u2019t from my experience on my talk show in this arena. In terms of my assumptions, I first assume from my experience serving in elected office that the most pressing research issue will be figuring out how Democrats can best reach MAGA Republicans, as opposed to vice versa. And secondly, I assume that more MAGA Republicans would openly identify as having hostility to Democrats, and express a potential unwillingness to communicate with those on the opposite political spectrum.\nPre-Work - Brief Topic Description\nAI shared that there is an existing wealth of information where the literature is strongest on this topic. I was first advised to explore the topic of Affective Polarization, which looks at the topics of partisan distrust and how there is an increasing level of hostility between partisans that expands beyond just basic policy disagreements. In terms of what\u2019s referred to as Contact Theory, AI suggested I look into research which has found intergroup contact - or the direct contact between Republicans and Democrats - has actually reduced prejudice, and observed voters actually adapt their political psychology. Next, AI discussed the existence of research on Political Deliberation, where scholars have studied cross-ideological discourse, and best practices of speaking to those across the aisle. And in terms of contemporary topics, AI spoke about the need to research Echo Chambers & Social Media, looking at existing literature about how these new online platforms have exacerbated the political separation of those who disagree.\nAI also identified multiple gaps within the existing research, which makes this topic both important and research-worthy. First, AI identified a gap regarding \u201cEmpirical Models for Reconnection\u201d, suggesting that there are fewer available studies which center around the concept of reconciliation in our personal lives, specifically in everyday settings like in our families and at work. Secondly, there is an existing research gap in terms of the differences of partisan outreach strategy, where more research is needed on how these different groups approach topics like building trust among one another, and finding ideological common ground. Lastly, AI suggested I look at the role of identity and emotion, sharing that while major focus has already been paid to cognition or attitude change, there is less research on the concepts of \u201cemotional repair, shame, pride, and belonging\u201d.",

  "final_critique": "The pre-work articulates a socially consequential and timely topic\u2014reducing cross-partisan hostility and improving interpersonal reconnection across ideological lines. The author\u2019s motivation is clear and grounded in lived experience, and the initial scan of relevant literatures (affective polarization, intergroup contact, deliberation, echo chambers) is directionally appropriate. The acknowledgement of personal bias is commendably explicit. However, at this stage the document reads as an initial scoping note rather than a research blueprint. It lacks a precise problem definition, formal research questions, theoretical constructs, and a tractable research design. The objectives conflate normative and partisan goals (e.g., helping one party win elections) with scholarly inquiry, which risks introducing confirmation bias and threatens credibility with diverse audiences.\n\nTo strengthen the foundations, formalize a small set of focused research questions and define key constructs (e.g., affective polarization, openness to discussion, reconciliation) with operational measures. Anchor the project in a clear theoretical framework that links identity threat, emotion, and contact (e.g., social identity theory, contact hypothesis with extended/mediated contact, motivated reasoning), and draw on established scales (feeling thermometers; social distance; trait stereotyping; identity centrality; RWA/SDO; discrete emotions like shame, pride, belonging).\n\nMethodologically, consider a mixed-methods, preregistered program: (1) qualitative discovery (interviews in family/workplace dyads with cross-partisan conflict); (2) survey experiments testing communication strategies (e.g., deep canvassing, values-affirmation, perspective-getting vs perspective-taking, bipartisan identity primes), with heterogeneous treatment effects by partisan identity strength; (3) field or lab-in-the-field trials with structured dialogue interventions, measuring short- and medium-term outcomes (openness, willingness to re-engage, relational quality). Employ validated measures, power analyses, attention to measurement invariance across parties, and multilevel models for dyadic/clustered data. Incorporate ethical safeguards for potentially distressing conversations and submit to IRB review.\n\nTo address bias and balance, explicitly include symmetric research aims (helping both Democrats and Republicans engage constructively), use preregistration, blinded coding of qualitative data, and independent advisory input. Expand the literature base to include canonical and recent work (e.g., Iyengar/Lelkes on affective polarization; Pettigrew & Tropp on contact meta-analyses; Broockman & Kalla on deep canvassing; Fishkin on deliberation; Bail on social media; Mason on identity-based polarization; Levendusky on depolarization). Finally, improve structure by removing duplicated prompts, adding citations, and mapping clear contributions (e.g., empirical models for reconnection in everyday settings, emotion-focused mechanisms of repair, and context-specific guidance for families vs workplaces).",
