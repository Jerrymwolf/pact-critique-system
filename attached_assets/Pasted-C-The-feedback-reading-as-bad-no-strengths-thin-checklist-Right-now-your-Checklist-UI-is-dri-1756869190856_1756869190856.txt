C) The feedback reading as “bad” (no strengths, thin checklist)
Right now your “Checklist” UI is driven by checklistItems. If that array doesn’t get populated from the richer qualitative output (per-dimension strengths/issues), you’ll see:
“Strengths (0)”
“Areas for Improvement (2)” with vague entries
Generic “Requires significant improvement” labels
Populate checklistItems from qualitative result (no slicing)
After you have result from the server:
function buildChecklistFromQualitative(result) {
  const out = [];
  const dims = result.dimension_feedback || {};

  for (const [dimName, d] of Object.entries(dims)) {
    // strengths → completed items
    for (let i=0; i<(d.strengths || []).length; i++) {
      const s = d.strengths[i];
      out.push({
        code: `${dimName.slice(0,3).toUpperCase()}-S${i+1}`,
        name: s.length > 80 ? s.slice(0,77) + '…' : s,
        description: s,
        completed: true
      });
    }
    // issues → uncompleted items with action
    for (let i=0; i<(d.issues || []).length; i++) {
      const it = d.issues[i];
      const firstSuggestion = (it.suggestions && it.suggestions[0]) || '';
      out.push({
        code: `${dimName.slice(0,3).toUpperCase()}-I${i+1}`,
        name: it.title || firstSuggestion || 'Revise',
        description: firstSuggestion || it.why_it_matters || '',
        completed: false,
        priority: it.priority || 'medium'
      });
    }
  }

  // Guarantee at least 2 strengths overall (never show “0”)
  const totalStrengths = out.filter(x => x.completed).length;
  if (totalStrengths < 2) {
    // simple, local fallback (non-LLM): pick two positive sentences from final_summary if present
    const pos = (result.final_summary || '').split(/[.!?]\s+/).filter(s => /clear|well|effective|strong|compelling|coherent/i.test(s)).slice(0, 2);
    pos.forEach((s, i) => out.push({ code: `GEN-S${i+1}`, name: s.slice(0,80), description: s, completed: true }));
  }

  return out;
}
Use it where you currently set checklistItems—and stop slicing arrays when rendering. Your current UI cuts content to 1–2 bullets in several places, which is why it feels generic.
const checklistItems = buildChecklistFromQualitative(result);
renderChecklist(checklistItems); // renders *all* items; group by priority
And in your “Detailed Findings” pane, render per-issue cards with:
Why it matters
Concrete suggestions
Exemplar rewrites (show a “Copy” button)
Quotes (2+) with spans
(That structure is already in your qualitative JSON; the UI just needs to show it, not compress it.)
