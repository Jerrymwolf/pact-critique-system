. Your OpenAI response_format schema is requiring a key named subsections at the wrong object level (or listing it in required without defining it in properties). In your taxonomy JSON, the nesting is:
dimensions → each dimension has sections
each section then has subsections
So if your schema for a dimension-level object lists subsections in required, that’s a mismatch—dimension objects have sections, not subsections. 
What to change (two safe options)
Option A — Fix the schema to mirror the JSON (recommended)
Model the hierarchy exactly as your taxonomy uses it:
export const DetailedDimensionCritique = {
  name: "DetailedDimensionCritique",
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    additionalProperties: false,
    properties: {
      dimension_id: { type: "string" },
      dimension_label: { type: "string" },
      overall_score: { type: "number" },
      rationale: { type: "string" },

      // Dimension level has SECTIONS (not subsections)
      sections: {
        type: "object",
        additionalProperties: {
          type: "object",
          additionalProperties: false,
          properties: {
            section_id: { type: "string" },
            section_label: { type: "string" },
            score: { type: "number" },
            rationale: { type: "string" },

            // Inside each section you have SUBSECTIONS
            subsections: {
              type: "object",
              additionalProperties: {
                type: "object",
                additionalProperties: false,
                properties: {
                  subsection_id: { type: "string" },
                  subsection_label: { type: "string" },
                  score: { type: "number" },
                  strengths: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
                  improvements: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } }
                },
                required: [
                  "subsection_id",
                  "subsection_label",
                  "score",
                  "strengths",
                  "improvements"
                ]
              }
            }
          },
          required: ["section_id", "section_label", "score", "rationale", "subsections"]
        }
      }
    },
    required: [
      "dimension_id",
      "dimension_label",
      "overall_score",
      "rationale",
      "sections" // <-- must be 'sections' here
    ]
  },
  strict: true
};
